## Video

The first video demonstrates **various applications of UnrealCV**, including: 

- Object mask generation in a virtual supermarket,  
- Bounding box generation, 
- Semantic point cloud generation,
- Running a detection algorithm in a virtual scene,
- Controlling hazardous factors to diagnose the robustness of stereo depth estimation algorithms, 
- Learning indoor navigation, robot manipulation and active object tracking via reinforcement learning.

The second video includes **various 3D scenes** that can be used in UnrealCV, including: 

- Diverse scenes,
- Three example scenes, Matinee, RealisticRendering, Roborecall,
- Physicial interaction, 
- Controlling the weather and the illumination.
